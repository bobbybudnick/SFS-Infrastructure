Tenets of Resilient Ethernet Micro Networks
-----

**Laying the Fabric**  
This is the basic groundwork for the network.  it was clear early on that
mutiple Internet gateways were required for high availability. Personal
experience has also shown that during digital and real world disasters it is
advantageous to have more than one Internet connection.

**Sewing the Servers**  
This is merging the network together in a coherent way.  There was more of a
focus on getting power usage and battery life under control.  A small
reorganization was needed with the addition of extra gateways resulting in the
network2point0 initiative.

**Troubles in the Tapestry**  
This is a catalog of glitches encountered during development.  Some with
networking equipment and some with hosts.  By far the longest time was spent
stuck on these problems so bypassing these will speed up the production of any
networking project.

**The Seer's Knowledge**  
This is networking information organized in a cheat sheet fashion.  For
deploying ever more advanced installations.  It can be added to and probably
will be added to here also.  It is important to take complex information and
word it in a way that is more understandable.

**Instructions for Incantations**  
The amount of scripts needed to enable the required functionality was a
suprise.  In a certain way these scripts are replacing typical enterprise
hardware networking options.  Scripts are sorted into a folder according to
associated features.  After copying make these executable.

This may include scripts that are expected to run during contingency events.
It is important to have a disaster response plan for your IT department to 
immediately respond to certain emergencies.  In the dark with alarms beeping
when you smell smoke and the wind is howling outside is too late to be
researching information.  You do not want to be hauling heavy batteries up
several flights of stairs during tornado conditions with emergency lighting only.
You do not want to be wondering if your last 2 computers will keep running when
most of your power sources have failed and there is a twister outside.

**Forbidden Tomes**  
There are certain documents that for reasons of security and practicality will
be unique for every network.  Some listed here will be sanitized examples that
absolutely must be edited with custom credentials.  Some examples displayed here
will be unique to the network but non-confidential.

5.streamlauncher
6.vnc server
7.worker 1
8.worker 2
Remember to edit the passcodes in these files.

**Fruits of the Quiltmaker**  
This is a list of what can be expected with a typical end result.  A product of
the struggle to get the network under control.  There is enough here to build
on and fill the switch ports further than they already are or stop building and
just enjoy what has been created.
