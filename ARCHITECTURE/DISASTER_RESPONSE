disaster response plan
organizational response to adverse events

power outage overview
typically main/media/internet server/phones are kept running
tv draws too much power so switch laptop to primary with xinitrc
other devices can stream from backup internet or watch local tv at 192.168.1.251
current plan is to shutdown 1 mid and not keep the other running at all

power outage procedures
gaming desktop and cable network devices run until battery is depleted in ups
large battery hosts stay running until manual intervention
commercial laptops on utility power can shutdown themselves - monitor 2/monitor 3
headless not practical because they stay powered - staging/camera 1/camera 2/ras
cpa shuts down custom laptops after 10 minutes - gaming/storage/backup storage

network outage - old - now automated - can speed up with script restart
use physical network switch to switch to backup router mode
lattepanda alpha/delta mid can attach directly to media tv or to backup router position
pc stick based mid goes to backup router position

hack attack
use cloudflare under attack mode - proxy does not work so it is too late for this
evaluate
potentially disconnect network
potentially reinstall
potentially restore backups

power sources - in order of practicality
vehicle mounted 25w solar panel - can not really use/already in use
100w solar panel partially shaded
vehicle mounted 200w solar panel??? - add wires to tie downs/load to vehicle battery
small 900w generator - dependent on available fuel
backup battery bank 100ahx2 - charge with various sources and use spare inverter
large ebike 200ah - one time use/solar recharge not practical in emergency
vehicle mounted inverter - dependent on available fuel/dangerous to run car unattended
