#this sfs server redundancy component goes on the virtualization server

#this one runs during guest runtime
#it is important to loop here
#because the backup server script will not continue until connection is closed

#looping makes the ui hang up control of the vm so better not do that
#so no longer really persistent
#but is in the sense that it tries to make sure it has taken over
#while true
#do

#start shutdown signal workers
/var/lib/vz/snippets/WORKER_1&
#/var/lib/vz/snippets/WORKER_2&

#give the workers time to do their thing and send the shutdown signal
sleep 30
killall WORKER_1
killall WORKER_2
killall nc

#do it once more but at some point we are sending signals to vm instead of backup

#start shutdown signal workers
/var/lib/vz/snippets/WORKER_1&
#/var/lib/vz/snippets/WORKER_2&
 
#give the workers time to do their thing and send the shutdown signal
sleep 30
killall WORKER_1
killall WORKER_2
killall nc

#just have to hope that we have signaled correctly by now

#done
